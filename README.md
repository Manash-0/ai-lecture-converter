<h1>AI Lecture Converter</h1>

The AI Lecture Converter is a full-stack web application that transforms PDF lecture notes into structured HTML webpages. It uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to read image-based PDFs and the Google Gemini API to generate detailed content. The app includes a secure admin panel for content management and a user-friendly interface with a dark mode for viewing the notes.

<h2>Core Features</h2>
Admin Features
Secure Authentication: Protected admin routes using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with a login system.

Dynamic Subject Management: Admins can add, edit, and delete subjects directly from the web interface.

Dynamic Unit Management: Admins can edit the names of all 6 units for any subject.

PDF to HTML Conversion: Upload PDF files (both text and image-based) to automatically generate lecture content.

OCR Integration: Uses Tesseract.js to extract text from image-based PDFs.

AI-Powered Content Generation: Utilizes the Google Gemini API to structure and detail the extracted text into high-quality HTML notes.

<h2>User Features</h2>
Subject-Based Navigation: Browse and select from a list of available subjects.

Structured Lecture View: View generated notes in a clean, two-column layout with a sidebar for navigation.

Dark/Light Theme: A theme toggle allows users to switch between light and dark modes for comfortable viewing.

Responsive Design: The interface is designed to be usable across different screen sizes.

<h2>Project Structure</h2>
The project follows a standard MVC-like pattern with a clear separation of concerns.

git clone [https://github.com/Manash-0/ai-lecture-converter.git](https://github.com/Manash-0/ai-lecture-converter.git)
cd ai-lecture-converter
```
<h3>3. Install Dependencies</h3>
Install all the necessary npm packages listed in package.json:
```bash
npm install
```
<h3>4. Configure Environment Variables</h3>
Find the .env.example file in the project root.

Rename it to .env.

Open the .env file and add your secret keys:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY"
JWT_SECRET="YOUR_OWN_RANDOM_SECRET_STRING"
```
<h3>5. Run the Server</h3>
